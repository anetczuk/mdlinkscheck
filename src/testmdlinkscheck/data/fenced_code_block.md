## Using 

Example of [fenced code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks)

Code block contains lambda definition in C++. It resembles syntax of links in Markdown, but should be converted to 
code without link inside it.


Example with backticks:
```c++
[content](link_backticks)

```

Example with tildes:
~~~c++
[content](link_tildes)

~~~
